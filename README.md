This project includes crop models in folders that were used in various studied that were published by members of LTSB.
In each folder, the README file contain a brief description of the model and how to cite them when using it.

The crop models are TRNSYS components that can be use to estimate the latent heat gain and convective heat gain/loss induced by crops. 
It can be used as inputs to the Type56 Multizone Building to include crops as internal gains/losses in a thermal zone.

SUMMARY OF THE MODELS' MAIN CHARACERISTICS :
-----------------------------------

      1- lettuces-steady-state : lettuces, steady-state LAI, steady-state CAC, LED lamps only, perfectly irrigated
      2- lettuces-dynamic : lettuces, dynamic LAI, dynamic CAC, LED lamps only, perfectly irrigated
