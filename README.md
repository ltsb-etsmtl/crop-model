This project includes crop models in folders that were used in various studied that were published by members of LTSB.
In each folder, the README file contain a brief description of the model and how to cite them when using it.

The crop models are TRNSYS components or can be linked to EnergyPlus. They can be use to estimate the latent heat gain and convective heat gain/loss induced by crops. 


MAIN CHARACERISTICS OF THE CROP MODELS
-----------------------------------

      1- lettuces-steady-state : lettuces, steady-state LAI, steady-state CAC, LED lamps only, perfectly irrigated
      2- lettuces-dynamic : lettuces, dynamic LAI, dynamic CAC, LED lamps only, perfectly irrigated
      3- lettuces-with-growth-model: lettuces, integrated growth model, solar and LED lamps, perfectly irrigated
      4- EnergyPlus lettuces-steady-state : lettuces, steady-state LAI, steady-state CAC, LED lamps only, perfectly irrigated
