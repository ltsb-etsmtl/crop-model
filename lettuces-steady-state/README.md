This project includes crop models in folders that were used in various studied that were published by members of LTSB.
The crop models are TRNSYS components that can be use to estimate the latent heat gain and convective heat gain/loss induced by crops. 
It can be used as inputs to the Type56 Multizone Building to include crops as internal heat gains/losses in a thermal zone.

DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------
- It is a steady-state model since the size of crops do not vary with the tim; thus the Leaf Area Index (LAI) is set as a simulation parameter in this version of the crop model. 
- It models lettuces in a controlled environnement and the algorithm was validated (Graamans et al., 2017).
